# The Mlatu Programming Language

[![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/brightly-salty/mlatu)](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei).

Mlatu is a statically typed, stack-based functional programming language designed for simplicity, speed, and safety. 

Very experimental: contributions welcome, but please don't use this in production. If you wish to contribute see [here](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## About the name

"Mlatu" is the Lojban word for "cat", referencing [Cat][Cat GitHub] by Christopher Diggins, [Kitten][Kitten Site] by Jon Purdy, and the fact that Mlatu is a con*cat*enative programming language.

"Mlatu" is pronounced "melatoo".

## Examples

Here's a naive recursive fibonacci function:

```
define fib (Int -> Int):
  -> n;
  if (n < 2):
    1
  else:
    (n - 2) fib + (n - 1) fib

20 fib print
```
See the examples folder for more.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

These installation instructions presume you have the Haskell Tool Stack installed. If you don't you can install it [here][Stack Installation].

Via `stack`:

```
git clone https://github.com/brightly-salty/mlatu.git
cd mlatu
stack install
```

Note: `cabal install` should also work.

### Usage

```
mlatu [OPTIONS] input-paths
  Interprets Mlatu code.

     --no-common --foundation-only  Compiles with the bare minimum prelude.
     --check                        Check syntax and types without compiling
                                    or running.
  -? --help                         Display help message
  -V --version                      Print version information
```

If `mlatu` is called without any input paths, an interactive REPL will be started. Type `//help` in the REPL for command options in the REPL.
