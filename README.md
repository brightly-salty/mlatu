# The Mlatu Programming Language

Mlatu is a statically typed, stack-based functional programming language designed for simplicity, speed, and safety. 

Very experimental: contributions welcome, but please don't use this in production.

## About the name

"Mlatu" is the Lojban word for "cat", referencing [Cat][Cat GitHub] by Christopher Diggins, [Kitten][Kitten Site] by Jon Purdy, and the fact that Mlatu is a con*cat*enative programming language.

"Mlatu" is pronounced "melatoo".

## Todo (unordered)

- [ ] Generate Rust code from IR

- [ ] Format IR back into Mlatu

- [ ] Rework syntax into something a little bit nicer

- [ ] Write a TextMate grammar for syntax highlighting
